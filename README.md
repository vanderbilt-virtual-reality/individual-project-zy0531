The version of Unity for this project is 2019.2.6f1

## How to play
The basic idea of this project is to create a casual game, with simple goals for users, but the most important purpose is about making them relax for a while in the virtual environment (VE) and finding the nature within themselves. The goal is to find four playing cards through exploring the scene and interact with items in the VE. There are four parts to pick up four cards in each, which also compares to 4 stages in one’s life. 
```
When users come into the game, they are surrounded by things, like circus tent, slides, floating monsters, etc. 
There is background music. 
Users can use the left thumbstick to move and right thumbstick to turn around, and use trigger to grab items.
```
The first one is cards just existing in front of users’ eyes when they come into the VE. It’s easy to get the first playing cards and the fire-breathing stone monsters symbolize an attractive but dangerous world for a newcomer. 
```
In this part, when users grab the cards, the sound effect tells that they get it and then cards will disappear. 
When users get close enough to these floating monsters, the monsters will spout flames, and stop when users leave.
```

The second part is to climb a high slide to get the second playing cards. When one just as a young adult enters society, full of spirit, he/she highly motivated goes ahead every day without thinking any danger on the way, until one day they suddenly find the world force him/her to the corner and show no way to go. Jump up bravely and afterwards change to another mindset, which is the precious life experience told in the second playing cards. 
```
In this part, users should climb along the track of the slide, 
and pick up the cards when they reach the top and then falling off, into a bunch of food.
```

In the third part, users are to get the cards in a high place above a small voxel world. One then learns how to achieve goals by seeking helps from external environment as well as from other people, also becoming more experienced and learning to be tactful.
```
In this part, due to the cards in high place, users should manipulate the kinematic items 
to construct steps to go that position and get the cards.
```

The final cards for the user to find exist close to the mask of the joker. This means to remove the masks and face one’s true self, eventually.
```
In this part, users can find the last ones in the circus tent in front of a huge mask.

## Motivation
Now that movie ‘Joker’ is a Hit, after watching Joker several weeks ago, I asked myself who is he and where did he come from. Not just Arthur Fleck, a mentally deranged social reject in the movie with a history of insanity, producing uncontrollable shrieks of laughter in the most tragic moments of life, we start to think that we know lots of the Jokers, and we are looking at the different psychologies of each Joker that may right be anyone around us or even ourselves. A joker as a social symbol should have been a happy and joyous one and give happiness and laughing to other people. People always go to circus for fun by watching jokers performing with big smile on faces and escape a while from the hustle and bustle of their daily life. But when you are there, have you thought about whether the joker is happy or not? Who is that joker you are watching? Is he the reflection in the mirror of yourself？Hard to tell which is the real world and who is the real Arthur Fleck. People want a place to relieve, to find what they really want and who they really are. Maybe they worry about the gaze of others, could not willfully express emotion for following the social rules, cannot get into that circus you would like to go after opening hours. 

## Why in VR
The thing is it is hard to relieve and let it go as you expect. So VR is good to go for psychology problems of people and for express oneself freely, without rules from society and physical limitation from real world. Long-term accumulation of negative emotion might convert you to one of the Jokers. Taking care of oneself and attaching importance to mental health are extremely significant.

Followed by the idea from Joker, I created a world with a virtual circus environment with bright, high saturated colors and cartoon-style models, as well as fun interaction with the items in this virtual world. I really want to bring users back to a world remaining deep in their mind, that they always like the most and can get pure happiness when they were young. To do what they want, to get rid of the trifles, to relieve from the annoyance and to refresh themselves as soon as possible. In this world, users are welcomed by red fire-breathing stone monsters as they come close to them; they can climb onto a high rotary slide and jump into a bunch of food; they can construct a small voxel world in your mind with kinematic boxes, or they can just enjoy rambling in the amusement park as long as they want.
